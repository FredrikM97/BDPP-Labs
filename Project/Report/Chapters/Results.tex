\section{Result}
The tests for the models were carried out with the same parameters for everyone to give a better overview of how the models performed. Logistic regression used the following parameters regParam: [0.1,0.01], maxIter: [10], elasticNetParam: [0.6]. Decision tree used the default settings. Random forest used numTrees: [15]. After reducing the number of rows, and performing preprocessing the final number of rows went from 2974335 to 2865076 and a total of 250 features that according to PCA covers 97.04\% of the dataset.
