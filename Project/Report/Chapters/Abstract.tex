%\section*{Abstract}
%The project consists of methods for how the dataset looks, analysis of the data and the processing methods used %to generate a feature vector for machine learning. The data is based on two reports %\cite{moosavi2019countrywide} \cite{moosavi2019accident} to analyze Severity at various locations in the United %States. The project also includes short state-of-the-art for big data, Hadoop and cloud computing. The result is %presented of the different models and a conclusion to elaborate the presented result. Future work is reasoned on %what could be improved and how it would affect the result. The project information is presented in jupyter %notebook with relevant analysis, preprocessing and evaluation of the models.
