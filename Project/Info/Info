# Report:

* Quantiles
* Optimization of spark "kernel" - Minimize GC, improve efficency
* Reduce feature vector
* Analyse relevant data
* Since we cant have all in memory we need to cache (increases GC time, more loading from storage), However since we can modify Storage memory this is hereby fixed
* Further improvements: Categorical values of weather and missing values (Unknown, low, medium, high), would reduce the amount of missing values and hopefully give a better value or get removed by a selection method -> Embedding might be needed
